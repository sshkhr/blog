### Startup

I was the co-founder of [Dice Health](https://dice.health), a startup that built automation tools for veterinary healthcare providers. My co-founder and friend [Abdullah](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/abdullahalhayali) and I started it in late 2023, were profitable from Day 1 since we never raised any funding, grew Dice to a team of 4, and finally sold it to our second enterprise customer in early 2025.

I am also the creator of [Awesome-MLSS](https://awesome-mlss.com/), a project I have been running since 2018 that curates summer schools in the field of machine learning. It has grown from a single markdown file on Github to a website, newsletter, and a community of over 50K annual visitors and 1000+ subscribers.

### Research

Beofre starting Dice, I used to work at Meta (Facebook) AI Research with [Dr. Ari Morcos](https://www.arimorcos.com/about/) on scaling laws, self-supervised computer vision, and foundation models. 

Before that, I was at the Vector Institute, working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group on conditional computation in neural networks, visual reasoning, and dynamic neural networks. 

Even further back, I was a research assistant at the Visual Computing Lab at the Indian Institute Of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](https://anirbanchakraborty.github.io/) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/), working on visual question answering, entity re-identification and object detection. 

### Engineering

I have several years of experience in machine learning and computer vision working with Vector Institute, NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore, & Samsung Research Institute Delhi.

### Consulting

I have consulted for various startups in Canada, and a few in the US and India on machine learning, computer vision, and more recently on large language models, data curation, and inference optimization.

### Education

I did my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph, with a specialization in Artifical Intelligence. I wrote my master's thesis on dynamic neural networks and cognitive science. You can read it here: [Inductive Biases for Higher-Order Visual Cognition](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/items/8d42d7d7-c0ca-411f-9b26-c3b682f47e16).

I did my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology Dhanbad.

Hello! I am a engineer and researcher of machine learning. Currently, I am the co-founder at [Dice Health](https://dicehealth.com/), a startup that is building a platform to help people with chronic conditions manage their health. 

Before starting Dice Health, I work at Meta (Facebook) AI Research with Dr. Ari Morcos on scaling laws, self-supervised computer vision, and foundation models. Before that, I was at the Vector Institute, working with Prof Graham Taylor at the Machine Learning Research Group on conditional computation in neural networks, visual reasoning, and dynamic neural networks. Even further back, I was a research assistant at the Visual Computing Lab at the Indian Institute Of Science working with Prof Anirban Chakraborty and Prof Anand Mishra, working on visual question answering, entity re-identification and object detection. 

I did my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph. I did my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology Dhanbad in 2017. Besides these experiences, I have over 3 years of experience in machine learning and computer vision working with NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore, & Samsung Research Institute Delhi.

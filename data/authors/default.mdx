## Current Role

I work as a Research Engineer on the Foundational Research Incubation team at Google DeepMind.

## Startups

I was the co-founder of [Dice Health](https://dice.health), a startup that built AI-based tools for solving administrative tasks in veterinary healthcare. I started Dice in late 2023 with my co-founder and friend [Abdullah](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/abdullahalhayali). We were bootstrapped and profitable from Day 1 and grew Dice to a team of 4 over 2 years. We sold Dice to one of our enterprise PMS customers in early 2025.

I am also the creator of [Awesome-MLSS](https://awesome-mlss.com/), an open-source project I have been running since 2018 that curates summer schools in the field of machine learning. It has grown from a single markdown file on GitHub to a website, newsletter, and a community of over 50K annual visitors and 1000+ subscribers.

## Research & Engineering

Before starting Dice, I worked at Meta (Facebook) AI Research with [Dr. Ari Morcos](https://www.arimorcos.com/about/) on scaling laws, self-supervised computer vision, and foundation models.

Prior to Meta, I was at the Vector Institute, working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group on conditional computation in neural networks, visual reasoning, and dynamic neural networks.

Even further back, I was a research assistant at the Visual Computing Lab at the Indian Institute of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](https://anirbanchakraborty.github.io/) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/), working on visual question answering, entity re-identification, and object detection.

I also have several years of experience in machine learning and computer vision engineering working with Vector Institute, NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore, & Samsung Research Institute Delhi.

## Consulting

I work as an independent consultant providing technical expertise to companies on building and scaling data pipelines for training large ML models, large model training and inference optimization, building fine-tuning and evaluation systems for AI solutions, and building production-ready GenAI applications.

In the past, I also served as a technical advisor to Vector Institute and a scientist-in-residence with NEXT Canada where I advised various startups as well as established companies on AI model development, deployment, and strategy.

I have worked with companies ranging from pre-seed startups to Fortune 500, across industries including FinTech, Climate Tech, MedTech, Broadcasting, AI Safety, and Oil & Gas.

See my [Contact](/contact) page for more details on past engagements and to book a consultation.

## Education

I did my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I wrote my master's thesis on dynamic neural networks and cognitive science. You can read it here: [Inductive Biases for Higher-Order Visual Cognition](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/items/8d42d7d7-c0ca-411f-9b26-c3b682f47e16).

I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad.

## Hi! I'm [Shashank Shekhar](/about)

I am a machine learning engineer and researcher. 

Currently, I am the co-founder at [Dice Health](https://dice.health), a startup that is building automation tools for healthcare administrators. 

## Research

I used to work at Meta (Facebook) AI Research with [Dr. Ari Morcos](https://www.arimorcos.com/about/) on scaling laws, self-supervised computer vision, and foundation models. 

Before that, I was at the Vector Institute, working with [Prof Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) at the Machine Learning Research Group on conditional computation in neural networks, visual reasoning, and dynamic neural networks. 

Even further back, I was a research assistant at the Visual Computing Lab at the Indian Institute Of Science working with [Prof Anirban Chakraborty](https://anirbanchakraborty.github.io/) and [Prof Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/), working on visual question answering, entity re-identification and object detection. 

## Education

I did my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph, with a specialization in Artifical Intelligence. I wrote my master's thesis on dynamic neural networks and cognitive science. You can read it here: [Inductive Biases for Higher-Order Visual Cognition](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/items/8d42d7d7-c0ca-411f-9b26-c3b682f47e16).

I did my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology Dhanbad. 

## Experience

Besides my research and education experiences, I have over 3 years of experience in machine learning and computer vision working with NEXT-AI Toronto, Layer6 AI Toronto, Shell R&D Center Bangalore, HyperWorks Imaging Bangalore, & Samsung Research Institute Delhi.

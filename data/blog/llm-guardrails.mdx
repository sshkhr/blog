As LLMs are becoming ubiquitous in software applications, software engineers and managers now required 
them to produce consistent, reliable, and predictable results.

## When should you use LLM guardrails?

Sample of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## What are the various approaches to implementing LLM guardrails?

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

## What are the limits of RAG style guardrails?

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
